# Kumis
This project aims to forecast daily kumis (fermented mareâ€™s milk) sales using historical data from 2022 and 2023. The goal is to reduce overproduction and optimize operations in a traditional kumis business by predicting future demand with temperature, holidays, and past sales trends.


# Objective
- Reduce milk waste due to overproduction
- Use machine learning (Random Forest Regressor) to forecast daily demand
- Consider external factors like temperature, weekends, and holidays
